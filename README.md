In this project we will be storing information about the game Clash Royale. Our database will include the information about the cards as well as the arenas in this game. The database will also store the information about the player, which will have a limited number of decks. A deck is a collection of cards. Each arena has a certain set of cards that become available to the user. The user will be able to create, insert, delete and read information from the database.
